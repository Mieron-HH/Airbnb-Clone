It has a cozy sleeping loft with a comfy queen bed, a full kitchen, a bathroom with a lovely tiled shower, walk-in closet space, and a sweet living room area with a vaulted ceiling.  Constructed using passive solar design, it stays just the right temperature all through the year and the south-facing windows and French doors allow light to stream in all day long.  On colder days, a radiant-heated floor system provides warmth by pumping water through tubing embedded in a beautifully-stained concrete floor, radiating heat through the rest of the house.  Finally, a photovoltaic solar system produces electricity from the sun!  The studio is nestled in a garden of winding flagstone paths, fruit trees, herbs, edible leafy greens, ferns, and low water-use flowering ornamental plants that attracts birds, squirrels, butterflies, and more.",

		"neighborhood_overview": "The neighborhood has a mix of commercial and residential properties. It is diverse in income levels and is at the edge of a riparian corridor, so it has a tiny bit of a wilderness feel even though it's in the middle of town and really close to Highway 1. On my street are two nurseries, an auto mechanic, and a trailer park. The house/lot right next to mine is currently vacant and boarded up.  I am about 1.5 miles from the ocean and am close to hiking trails in the hills with redwoods and streams. Within one mile are popular restaurants such as The Shadowbrook, Cafe Cruz, Chaminade, Gayle's Bakery, and a new brew pub, (website hidden)'s Alley is a popular bar with live music several nights of the week. You can drive to 41st Ave. in less than 5 minutes where there are coffee shops, a mall, and restaurants. In less than 2 miles is the Santa Cruz yacht harbor where you can rent kayaks, surfboards or stand up paddleboards- or board a sailing vessel for a sunset cruise on the Monterey Bay. Ca",
		"notes": "The freezer is tiny; not much more than a pint of ice cream can easily fit inside of it.",
		"transit": "Parking is easy as I provide a place to park right in the driveway. A major bus line (Santa Cruz Metro) is located about 5 blocks from the studio.  It is easy to bike around Santa Cruz and Capitola as there are many designated bike lanes. There are places to rent bikes if you want.  The best way to get here from the airport is to rent a car or take the bus (easier from San Jose, more challenging from SFO).",

		"host_about": "Hi!\r\n\r\nI am so happy you are looking at my adorable studio as a possible place to stay. I think you will love it! I've been living in Santa Cruz for 17 years and in this studio in the Live Oak neighborhood for 18 months. I feel grateful everyday to live in such a wonderful little place. When I first moved in I thought \"this place would be an amazing Airbnb spot\", but couldn't bring myself to share it at that time. I wanted it all to myself! :) Now that I'm settled in and have everything arranged just so, I feel excited to share the bounty with others such as yourself. \r\n\r\nAs I described, the studio is eco-friendly, beautiful, and is tucked in a magical wonderland of a garden with a hot tub and an adjacent open lot that makes it feel a bit on the wild side. My landlords are some of the sweetest and most generous people I know and share the backyard with me. \r\n\r\nOne of my favorite things about this place is how the moonlight streams in through the loft windows when it is out at night and how I can sometimes hear a great-horned owl hooting in the distance. I also love walking the short flagstone path to get into the hot tub almost every night before I go to bed. The hot tub is shared by my landlords and is located on their back porch, but I pretty much have it all to myself whenever I go. \r\n\r\nMy favorite places in Santa Cruz to explore are the ones I can easily bike to from my home. Now that I am living here, that includes the hiking trails on the Chaminade land, Schwan Lake State Park, and the many beaches in our area (especially Black's Beach and Seabright Beach). I also love exploring Wilder Ranch and Natural Bridges State Parks on the westside. I would be happy to point you to some of the many local sweet spots. \r\n\r\nI've practiced yoga for more than 20 years and have been meditating daily for almost 9 years. Because of this (I think), my home has a really peaceful vibe to it that I hope you will be able to feel. \r\n\r\nPlease be in touch if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing from you!",

Located on a quiet residential street. Lovely room with your own bathroom. Quiet, peaceful backyard. Very spacious 4 bedroom house. Lots of light, beautifully landscaped. Great art. Access to living room, dining room, kitchen, and backyard.  We are happy to interact with guests. My wife is German, and I was born in Los Angeles. We both have traveled extensively worldwide. Coffee and European breakfast available each morning. If you happen to be around, we might ask you to join us for dinner. On the other hand, if you prefer little contact, there is lots of privacy, and plenty of comfort inside and out. Beautiful garden outside and wonderful art inside our home.  The neighborhood is very quiet and peaceful. Friendly neighbors. Bus stop a 3 minute walk from the house. Bikes may be available. Reservations at least 3 weeks in advance.",

		"host_about": "I was lucky enough to have lived in France for a few years and traveled extensively throughout Europe. Many of my adventures were with three small children in tow so I'm fairly well versed in all things children and how to vacation with kids successfully. I still have two boys underfoot(13&15) so while we were putting our beach home together I was trying to make it comfortable and functional. I spent many summers in a lakeside cabin in Michigan and never once worried about whether I had sand on my feet as I traipsed through the house.   My idea of a perfect vacation is to be able to walk everywhere, life as a mom requires far too much driving! Our girl in Santa Cruz allows me to stroll to Pacific Avenue(groceries, restaurants and movies) as well as a one block mosey to the sand. In my opinion if I can avoid getting in my car, it's a WIN!\r\n\r\n I'm outnumbered and live with all guys so my movie habits seem to involve a lot of exploding robots or superheroes. I'm also more apt to be found at the pizza place with the Samurai wielding pizza thrower than I am at the \"new place.\" My youngest is an avid hamburger fan so currently we are eating our way through the Burger Joints.  Betty's Burgers is the top ranked  in Santa Cruz to date. (one location up the hill and one on Pacific Avenue) Their happy hour pitcher of mojitos is not bad either. Keep in mind the food critic is a 12yo boy-he will agree that the Buttery on Soquel Ave. (with their outside picnic tables) is still our top ranked destination to eat breakfast or lunch in the Cruz.",

There are two large windows, a sliding glass door, and a smaller window that afford plenty of views of the greenery all around. All the windows have good blinds so you don't have to worry about too much sun getting in. There is also a skylight which lets in natural light that makes the daytime in the cabin almost as cool as the night.  The cabin's night lighting includes two large spherical paper lanterns one yellow, one blue, as well as solid orange holiday type lights. There's a fiberoptic light in the skylight, as well as a smattering of other multicolored lights around the room which definitely give it a uniquely cool atmosphere.

		"description": "This quiet, one room, hexagonal gazebo-type cabin is located down the hill from the main housing unit it is a part of. The large windows give panoramic views of the forest all around, and you can also enjoy the fresh air from the attached deck.  The cabin is nestled in the woods, with plenty of incredible natural views, which paired with the quiet atmosphere, make for the perfect getaway spot, whether you're alone or traveling with someone.  There are two large windows, a sliding glass door, and a smaller window that afford plenty of views of the greenery all around. All the windows have good blinds so you don't have to worry about too much sun getting in. There is also a skylight which lets in natural light that makes the daytime in the cabin almost as cool as the night.

		"neighborhood_overview": "The neighborhood is quiet, family friendly, and very very very safe. There are many interesting houses on the block, along with some hiking trails and beautiful meadows within a 10 minute walk. The beach is about a 10 minute drive, as well as downtown Santa Cruz. Capitola and Soquel are near too. This location is very central to everything.",
		"notes": "My name is Nicholas/Nikki/Nick, I'm a pilot and musician, and am often not home. I thought this beautiful cabin was going to waste during my time not here (very often), so I arranged with my landlord and housemates to have guests over to add some new energy to our unique house.  Everyone that lives in our house dabbles in the arts, appreciates good food, music, and company. They are all just as capable of talking for hours as they are minding their own matters, it's up to you to engage them however you please.  You will always have fresh towels and sheets upon checkin, and if you need anything Paul the main cool cat/landlord/house owner will be able to help. In rare instances where he isn't answering your calls I'll be available as well. Another thing to NOTE: getting from the street to the cabin and cabin to main house requires a fair bit of climbing/descending of stairs, it isn't very conducive to those who may have injuries  or handicapped air bnbers that may have issues with stairs",
		"transit": "The house is located 1 mile up the hill from the nearest bus stop, we are currently working on having bikes available for our guests. Car parking is ample on our street. Info on public transit from SJC airport: (website hidden) SFO is similar plus a BART ride from the airport to Millbrae, then a CalTrain ride to San Jose Diridon Station, then the Hwy 17 Express to Downtown Santa Cruz. Public transit from the Bay Area airports is doable, but often difficult and requires planning and substantial time.",

		"host_about": "I was lucky enough to have lived in France for a few years and traveled extensively throughout Europe. Many of my adventures were with three small children in tow so I'm fairly well versed in all things children and how to vacation with kids successfully. I still have two boys underfoot(13&15) so while we were putting our beach home together I was trying to make it comfortable and functional. I spent many summers in a lakeside cabin in Michigan and never once worried about whether I had sand on my feet as I traipsed through the house.   My idea of a perfect vacation is to be able to walk everywhere, life as a mom requires far too much driving! Our girl in Santa Cruz allows me to stroll to Pacific Avenue(groceries, restaurants and movies) as well as a one block mosey to the sand. In my opinion if I can avoid getting in my car, it's a WIN!\r\n\r\n I'm outnumbered and live with all guys so my movie habits seem to involve a lot of exploding robots or superheroes. I'm also more apt to be found at the pizza place with the Samurai wielding pizza thrower than I am at the \"new place.\" My youngest is an avid hamburger fan so currently we are eating our way through the Burger Joints.  Betty's Burgers is the top ranked  in Santa Cruz to date. (one location up the hill and one on Pacific Avenue) Their happy hour pitcher of mojitos is not bad either. Keep in mind the food critic is a 12yo boy-he will agree that the Buttery on Soquel Ave. (with their outside picnic tables) is still our top ranked destination to eat breakfast or lunch in the Cruz.",

You can walk to the beach for coffee and breakfast at the Picnic Basket in the morning, bask in the sun on the deck in the cottage in the afternoon, and then walk downtown for dinner at night. Also, the walking path and pontoon path in Neary Lagoon is a hidden treasure, with all sorts of beautiful wildlife.",
		"notes": "Like many other popular rentals, we have been contacted by the city to collect a transient occupancy tax of 11% of the total cost (before AirBNB fees). I'm sure all rentals will be collecting this very soon (all hotels currently collect it) - help us in being compliant with the law :).  The tax is included in the price and breaks down as follows: Summer weekday price: (phone number hidden) Summer weekend price: (phone number hidden) Winter weekday price:(phone number hidden) Winter weekend price: (phone number hidden) Cleaning fee: 30 + 11% = 33 Each additional person per night over 2 people: 10 + 11% = 11 We are very pleased to share our living space with you.  Occasionally, our very friendly medium-sized dog, Kona, pays a visit and roams the yard.  Please be sure you are comfortable with this! Two night minimum if staying Saturday night (i.e. Friday and Saturday or Saturday and Sunday).",

Richard is a retired, former printing company owner, the inventor of a successful golf product. I quit my law librarian day job some years ago to have a more flexible lifestyle. We are outdoors enthusiasts, we enjoy interesting people and diverse cultures.  We believe if everyone had the opportunity to travel it would be a much better world.\r\n\r\nFive things we can't live w/o : good friends, good coffee, good wine, good food and good health, and not necessarily in that order.\r\n\r\nWe decided to join AirBnB based on the enthusiastic reviews our friends give the program (they are guests, not hosts). We enjoy meeting people and sharing the incredible area we are so fortunate to live in... so we decided to give 'hosting' a try. You are cordially invited to visit us in beautiful Bonny Doon!",

Two blocks away is a modest shopping center which hosts the local farmer's market on Sunday mornings. A handful of eateries and a coffee shop, from fast food to upscale dining, line the two blocks toward the beaches. A back way to the beach (our special secret) is three lovely blocks, two of which are walking/biking trails, one lined with Cypress trees, and the next along a lagoon lined with Eucalyptus trees. The Harbor and Crows Nest restaurant and nightclub are a several blocks to the west along the shore. Downtown Santa Cruz is 3 miles west and Capitola, a quaint seaside town, is 2 miles east. Both are easily accessible by bike lanes, public transportation and car.",

Feel free to leave luggage on the porch and make yourselves at home if you wish to arrive early or stay late. Santa Cruz area has been suffering a severe water shortage, and water is rationed. We have installed low flush toilets, we re-use grey water when possible, and we ask our guests to minimize their water usage.  NOTE: If you are interested in receiving massage, acupuncture, cranio-sacral therapy or Rolfing here, then message me and",

The local bus service hooks up with service to San Jose, Caltrain, and all the Bay Area Transit systems including both San Jose and San Francisco Airports. From the airport, use Bay Area Transit system to Diridon Station in San Jose. From there you can catch the Hwy 17 Express to Santa Cruz. From the Santa Cruz downtown station take Santa Cruz Metro Bus 66 or 68 (Live Oak) to the bus stop nearest the intersection of 17th and Portola. The intersection is 2 blocks from our house.

Our back patio was in the top 10 in a Sunset magazine contest for \"Small Spaces - Big Dreams\". You'll have complete access to our condo.  Please treat it with love and care. You can text us if you have any questions. Our beautiful condo neighborhood borders Rodeo Gulch, so you get a little dose of nature. We have lots of trees surrounding our place, plus big beautiful Redwood trees on the other side of our back fence.  Don't be surprised if you hear coyotes barking in the night. You'll have two parking passes to park nearby. Our 18 year old, very sweet cat, Charlie, will be at the house with you.  She's a housecat and stays inside.  She actually doesn't do much but stay on the bed all day and night, and loves to snuggle",

		"host_about": "I graduated from University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC) back in the days when the students adopted the banana slug as the school mascot, there were no grades and Natural Bridges State Beach Park had two natural bridges over the ocean. After four years, I was ready to leave Santa Cruz for life in the big city- San Francisco! I re-discovered Santa Cruz after being gone for almost two decades and planning my 20th college reunion. The timing coincided with the birth of our child. I experienced what the area had to offer and was impressed by the changes and reassured by the familiarity. Santa Cruz is an easy getaway from our San Francisco family home. We find the drive very therapeutic with the transition from our fast paced lives to our Santa Cruz sanctuary. The 75 minute drive to Santa Cruz from San Francisco is beautiful through the evergreens on Highway 17 or by the ocean on Highway 1.",

		"neighborhood_overview": "The Seabright neighborhood is perfectly located between the boardwalk and the marina. Both are just under a mile from the cottage. It is warmer and sunnier than the rest of town and therefore called the \"banana-belt\" of Santa Cruz. Seabright beach is your \"classic beach\". The wide sands stretch beneath the bluffs. The facilities are decent with flush toilets and an outdoor shower. Lifeguards keep you safe during the summer season. There are fire rings for evening bonfires. There are a handful of restaurants in the heart of Seabright, and you are only 1.5 miles from all the shops and eateries on Pacific Street, downtown. You are in the middle of everything, yet living on a quiet neighborhood street, perfect for peaceful evenings at home.",
		"notes": "ABOUT THE HOUSE My husband Albert and I live at the cottage part time. We also live with my daughter when work requires us to be in the valley, which at the moment is too often. Thus, the house is not a pure vacation rental; we have personal belongings there. Half the dresser is empty for guests' clothes, more than half the closet is empty. You will see our toothbrushes in the medicine cabinet, etc. We live minimally so there is no clutter, but we do not move out between guests. There is a security camera watching for uninvited intruders.  There is a second house on the property with long term renters. They have a small dog and two cats. The yard is divided in two so you each have your own space.  There is no dishwasher and no microwave. ABOUT SANTA CRUZ Watch sailboat races at the Santa Cruz Small Craft Harbor on Wednesday nights 6:30 to 8:30 PM April through October. Capitola Art & Wine Festival September 12 & 13 from 10 AM to 6 PM. FREE Movies on the Beach: Wednesday nights at 9:00p",

		"host_about": "Hello, my name is Charlotte and I am excited to be a host for Airbnb. I love meeting new people and look forward to hosting folks coming through town. I live right next door to this rental with my adorable Jack Russell, Jerry Lee, so I will be available and nearby if you have any questions. \r\n\r\nI am a textile artist and own my own small business called Stand West, where I design and hand make a range of luxury, eco conscious accessories using custom dyed fabrics and mostly repurposed materials. If you are extra curious check out @standwestcreations on Instagram. \r\n\r\nIn addition to Stand West I am a Hip Hop Dance Teacher and work with Crush Sunglasses (a company based in the LA area) as their Northern California lifestyle rep. \r\n\r\nDespite growing up in beautiful Colorado and having the opportunity to explore every state in the USA, Santa Cruz has a strong hold on my heart. Here I spend the majority of my free time at the skate park located just a few blocks from Riverside Ranch, running on West Cliff, visiting the farmers markets that are held every day of the week throughout town, taking my dog to the beach, hiking in the redwoods with friends, and working with the community to make this city even better then it already is. \r\n\r\nI have been blessed beyond my own imagination to travel many places across the globe through the benefits of having  a mother as a Airline Stewardess. Because of all of my experiences being away from home I have a huge heart for making sure that your stay is the best it can be. Staying somewhere that feels like home, rather then in a hotel, makes all of the difference for me when I am exploring new places. Thank God for Airbnb. ; ) \r\n\r\nI hope to have the chance to get to know you and whether or not you decide to stay at Riverside Ranch I'll be wishing for you the best experiences while you are here in Santa Cruz. \r\n\r\nLight and Love!\r\n\r\nCharlie",

The boardwalk is an easy 10 minute walk, take the little ones to boogie board in the surf, eat cotton candy, ride roller coasters, and play video games for hours of easy entertainment.  Pack a picnic, bring lots of sunscreen and enjoy the pacific ocean! The front yard is fenced, as is the back garden.  There's a studio apartment in the back yard, you will have to share the garden if there's guests but there's plenty of room for both of you to have privacy.

There will be some suggested activities including where to rent bikes and get surfing lessons when you arrive. The neighborhood is a very eclectic mix. Many single, 30 something professionals, young Latino families, college kids, hipsters, travelers, and artists. We love the hip, young, colorful vibe.",
		"notes": "Santa Cruz is known for petty theft... no matter where you stay... lock up the cars and gates to keep bikes safe.",
		"transit": "With so much to do within walking distance including grocery shopping and the beach... you really don't need a car.  However there's plenty of street parking and most of downtown is metered parking. Our neighborhood is perfect for biking, bring your own or rent one from one of the bike shops nearby.  The bus system around Santa Cruz is relatively good. There's a bus stop on our street.  (website hidden) Taxi's are readily available and Uber is here too! We recommend the Santa Cruz Flyer if you need an airport ride. (website hidden) The closest airport to Santa Cruz is San Jose (35 minutes) - airport code: SJC. Other airports would be Oakland (OAK), San Francisco (SFO), Monterey (MRY)",

		"description": "Our peaceful home in the Bonny Doon area of the Santa Cruz mountains is surrounded by trees and birdsong, a quiet retreat that is still centrally located. Enjoy the garden and orchard, the redwood grove, the hot tub, and a warm local welcome! The beauty of the Santa Cruz mountains awaits you! Our home is situated exceptionally well, balancing accessibility with seclusion. Ten minutes to Felton's quaint main street,  fifteen minutes to the beach, twenty minutes to downtown Santa Cruz, ninety minutes to San Francisco up scenic Highway 1. But when you are sipping tea or a beer on the porch, you'll hear nothing but the hummingbirds and the wind in the trees.  We have two bedrooms for rent in our home. This listing is for one of the rooms - check my other listing if you have a larger party and would like to rent the other room as well, or you need other dates available.

		"neighborhood_overview": "Bonny Doon is a charming community in the mountains, blending serious old-timers with vacation-home implants, and intentionally keeping itself \"rural and natural.\" The people here consciously cultivate a sense of community and are genuinely friendly.  The beauty of the Santa Cruz mountains is phenomenal. Our home is centrally located between several state parks: Big Basin, Henry Cowell (to which we are adjacent), Wilder Ranch and Waddell Beach.  The beach town of Davenport is fifteen minutes away, and boasts a good restaurant (the Roadhouse), a locally-famous cafe/bakery, frequent live music, and a sprinkling of shops, all with Pacific views. The mountain towns of Felton, Ben Lomond, and Boulder Creek area also nearby and quaint.  Nearby Santa Cruz is full of charms that include and transcend its tourist-spot reputation! Don't miss going to the beach - the boardwalk for tourist tradition, or colorful Capitola, or one of many secluded coves such as Bonny Doon Beach. Enjoy the chic Pacif",

Parking is simple and abundant. The nearest airport is Monterey, which is quite nice, though it's small - SFO is just over an hour away. Rental cars are abundantly available there. Taxis and Uber are difficult to find in this area.",

The varieties of human experience are fascinating to me - I'm an anthropology graduate student and avid reader.

Enjoy privacy on the deck for your morning tea, sit with us by the fire and share a glass of wine and travel stories, gather up tips for all the good spots to eat and play nearby. We have lived all over the Bay Area and know it well - I am a native Californian and Karim is a charming French transplant. We share our home with a delightful dog who is extremely mellow and friendly with people - he's a medium size English Setter / Australian Shepherd mix - and a grey cat who loves to be pet. Between us, we have traveled to over 30 countries and have lived in Germany, Ghana, Italy, and Sweden.",

You can take a connector bus from downtown Santa Cruz metro station.  Walking to Downtown: Go downhill (East) on High Street. Cross over Highway 1 bridge. Continue on High Street. Cross park diagonally. Cross at crosswalk and walk down hill on Water Street. The Clock Tower and Pacific Avenue are at the bottom of the hill. Downtown will be to your right.  Other walking destinations: it is about a 20 minute uphill walk through a residential neighborhood to get to the hiking trails of the Pogonip. I recommend going down High Street to Highland.

I've now spent most of my life in Santa Cruz and I am a big fan of keeping the integrity of Pleasure Point, architecturally and as a community. My house was built in 1928 which is a big representation of the history of this area.  As this area was once one of the last \"surf ghettos\" in California it is known by its sweet beach cottages and community feel.  I pride myself on maintaining my cottage for others so they can experience old Santa Cruz.  Traveling and surfing or maybe surfing and traveling are a few of the greatest loves in my life. There is so much to be learned when visiting other places, peoples and stepping outside our comfort zone.  My love for surfing has taken me across the globe and I've definitely seen there is always an exchange in life:  In order to get respect it is important to give respect.  I've been humbled more than once in the ocean and on land. ;-)  Please enjoy enjoy enjoy Santa Cruz and this sweet little cottage in the heart of Pleasure Point.  Bienvenidos.",

Other walking destinations: it is about a 20 minute uphill walk through a residential neighborhood to get to the hiking trails of the Pogonip. I recommend going down High Street to Highland.

Years ago, I was a restauranteur in Chicago, then a full time studio potter, then a career in corporate sales and marketing.\r\n\r\nI've traveled extensively, usually on a quest to find indigenous, traditional regional foods. Desert beans in India, grilled squid from a street vendor in Hong Kong, fresh rambutan in Thailand, black mole in Mexico, and hay soup in Austria are just a few memorable tastes. I am inspired by these experiences and I cook with international flavors.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, I began to dream about having a farm where I could produce more of the foods, meats, and wines that I love. That dream came true when we bought FlipJack Ranch. Ranch life suits me, waking up to gather fresh eggs, cuddling the baby chicks, wrangling the goats, walking out to see the wooly pigs with a cup of coffee in hand. The whole 'farm to table' thing is real here on the ranch and the sustainable, organic and free range food products are my inspiration for daily menus. I love to forage too, here or nearby,  bringing back mushrooms, salad greens or mussels for the table. \r\n\r\nAs a traveler myself, I value warm hospitality and those little things that make a stay memorable. I love it when I can go to a place and just unwind, assured that everything is there and I can just relax. I hope to make your stay with us memorable.",

Opt for a quiet weekend on the property or venture out for easy access to wine tasting, biking, hiking, surfing or playing on the rugged north county beaches.   Each day as we drive up the mountain to our home we feel the rest of the world slipping away.

At night don't be surprised to hear coyotes or owls, and when it's clear with no moon the stars are bright and you can see the Milky Way.  The neighborhood is quiet, and we ask our guests to be respectful of the quiet and the overall environment.   Our larger neighborhood includes Davenport and many beautiful and rugged beaches along Highway 1.  If you would like to hear about local hikes and beaches please ask us. Easy access to State Parks:  \u2022 Fall Creek ~5 minutes \u2022 Coast Dairies ~10 minutes \u2022 Wilder Ranch ~15 minutes \u2022 Big Basin (Waddell Beach) ~20 minutes \u2022 Ano Nuevo - under 25 minutes",
		"notes": "We are a multi-generational family of 5 living on the property.  We have two young kids who always love to meet new people but we also respect the privacy of our guests.  During your stay we will be around - gardening, playing, etc., feel free to come out and say hello. The barn contains a small woodshop that is sometimes used for periods of time during the day.  We will do our best to not be involved in any projects while you're here, but on occasion you may hear the sound of a wood saw or hammering. The county of Santa Cruz requires that all Airbnb hosts collect an 11% Transient Occupancy Tax (same as hotels). As Airbnb at this time does not have a way in which to collect this tax as part of your fees, we ask our guests upon departure, to please leave 11% of their room charge, either by cash or check, in order to pay this tax to the county of Santa Cruz.  Thank you!",

The alternate access is from Highway 17 to Felton  Empire Road, if you're looking for extended twisting mountains roads this is the road for you!  Bus stop a 3 minute walk from the house - the bus will take you to Santa Cruz...slowly. Parking is  close to the studio, free, safe & easy. Davenport is 10 minutes from the house. Santa Cruz westside is 20 minutes from the house.",

By day, I work in the veterinary field and my husband teaches environmental science to kids.  During our free time, together we enjoy traveling, snow boarding, rock climbing, scuba diving, music festivals and camping.  My biggest passion is horseback riding and my husband is a die hard surfer who also enjoys working in the garden and relaxing in his hammock while listening to reggae tunes.  We are both very passionate about the environment and doing our part to reduce our footprint on this planet. \r\n We love traveling and seeing the world and we make an effort to travel out of the county about every other year.  We have been to places such as Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Costa Rica, Panama, Nicaragua, Hawaii, Europe, Philippines and Sri Lanka.   When we travel, we travel without any specific agenda and let life guide us to where we belong.  All we need is our trusty Lonely Planet guide book and we find ourselves at great hostels where like minded travelers gather to share stories and experiences.  We enjoy good company and fun positive people that inspire us to become better individuals.  We are fortunate in where we live and the beautiful home we live in and we would be blessed to share it with others while we are out on our own life adventures.  Our motto in life: \"Find what you love and love what you find.\"",

We are one mile from the beach and boardwalk and a quarter mile from downtown. The beach is a short 5 minute bike ride or 20 minute walk.  Even closer to home, walk a few blocks to Emily\u2019s Bakery, Sabieng Thai, or Taqueria Vallarta. We are also only a few blocks from an organic grocery and health store.   Our neighborhood is filled with some of the oldest Victorian\u2019s in the City; including ours. This property was established in 1888. However, the cottage was built in 2006.",

		"host_about": "We're Paul and Toki!  Here are our individual profiles:\r\n\r\nHello, Paul here. Santa Cruz provides many of the things I enjoy: Good, natural food, alternative life styles, beaches, woods, hiking, camping, art, wine....The list goes on. The downtown movie theater even has recliners! I'm a sucker for big-budget blockbusters.\r\n\r\nI've traveled to many places around the world, including Germany, France, Japan, several states, including Hawaii (possibly my favorite), and of course, all over California.  I'd like to visit England, The Netherlands, and Australia someday.  When I travel, I like to be out for at least a week, two if I can. I don't want to stay in one place for more than three days, as I figure I'm in a new place I may never see again; I want to see as much of it as I can. I'll see all the tourist sites, of course, but I also like to wander off and get a little lost.  Maybe go where I'm not supposed to go.\r\n\r\nI'm obsessed with learning about health.  I'm not someone who forces you to listen about the maladies that refined sugar can bring or anything, I keep it to myself.  I find the relationship between what we eat and think turning into the body we live in to be fascinating, and there's always more to discover and experience.\r\n\r\nI write music occasionally, and would like to be a teacher of sorts.  I'd like to make this world of nutrition and health as exciting for others as it is for me, and I think the way its taught now (lectures, seminars, books) can be a turn off for many, even though the information can be life-saving.  I'm currently trying to figure out a way to present this fascinating material in a more engaging, entertaining way.\r\n\r\n***********************************************\r\n\r\nHello, Toki Here!\r\n  I'm from the East Coast, but my heart has always called this place Home!\r\nSanta Cruz is my kind of town; city amenities, but a small-town, meet your friends everywhere feel that fosters kinship, kindness, and caring for our little piece of Earth. I love the mix of Art, Culture, Oddities, and Social Involvement. It's so easy, here, to get out and be active. There is always something going on, from the documented festivals and music, to the impromptu, but always reliable, marathon drum circle on the levees. People watching is one of our favorite wind-downs, and we are just minutes from Downtown by foot!\r\n   I'm an artist and Professional Organiser. The former is my passion, as I love to create and express, verbally, musically, and through miniature art pieces and photography. I also love to cook, and am always challenged by new dietary restrictions we try out as we search for our optimal health. I love sun, and try to get as much of it as possible. It's not hard, here! My goal is to use my specific skills to help those that I reach in my interactions, be it business, personal, or otherwise. If I were to sum up my purpose here, it would be; \"Leave it better than I found it\"\r\n  I love to travel, and when I do, I love to stay in small, intimate, homey places, that seem welcoming and have a bit of history. I love to feel like a part of where I'm at, so the more my accommodations welcome me, the better. I definitely love that I can provide that experience here, and have a welcoming home with healthy food, good literature,  and fresh linens ready for our out-of-town guests!",

		"neighborhood_overview": "Our home is located 3 miles north of downtown Santa Cruz.  We are on a private road in a rural neighborhood so there's lots of open space (but with the convenience of a little store at the end of the road). Drive to the beach (about 5 miles) or, better yet, park the car at Felton's Roaring Camp and take the open-air train through the redwoods to the beach and boardwalk.  Check out the Santa Cruz Surf Museum, or join the locals walking/running/skating on West Cliff Drive.  Hike or bike the miles of trails in Henry Cowell State Park (the back entrance is right across the road) or take a private, guided horse-back ride through the forest.  Ride a zipline through the canopy at Mount Hermon, or trek the Skyline-to-Sea Trail from Big Basin State Park to the coast.  Paddle a sea kayak through Elkhorn Slough, visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium, or enjoy shopping and dining in charming Carmel village.  Taste award-winning wines at one of the dozens of Santa Cruz mountain wineries or, if it's golf",
		"notes": "This is an excellent spot for mountain biking and hiking.  Henry Cowell State Park, which is right across the road, has 15 miles of hiking and riding trails through a variety of forested areas, including huge redwoods.  The garage is available upon request to store bicycles, surfboards, and other outdoor equipment.  Wine-tasting is also a popular past-time, since there are literally dozens of wineries nearby (which are known for their pinots).",
		"transit": "There is a local bus on the closest major road, but most guests will arrive by car. There is ample free parking in the driveway or in front of the house (which is very safe since our road is private). Guests flying into San Jose should take Highway 17 towards Santa Cruz; those flying into San Francisco can take either Highway 17 or Highway 1 toward Santa Cruz. Detailed directions will be provided upon request.",

My passion is gardening, and I also love hiking through the redwoods in the park across from my house.  I eat healthy (more or less), stay relatively physically fit, and try to maintain a good mental attitude.  I suppose I am a typical Santa Cruzer, pretty laid-back about most things.  Not the best cook in the world, although I occasionally get inspired to try something creative in the kitchen.  My style of guesting/hosting?

		"host_about": "I purchased Casa de Alta Loma in 2013 as the fulfillment of a life-long dream to live close to a beautiful beach, in an environment that soothes the soul. I have lived in and around Santa Cruz for a decade now and finally decided on just the right spot (Live Oaks) and the perfect home (Alta Loma). I use it often and enjoy the environment tremendously.  For example, Stand Up Paddle in the harbor and out to sea is one of my favorite things to do - The SUP shack is minutes from my doorstep and if you're lucky, you'll see all sorts of marine life (whales too!). It's such a unique place - we even have a Saturday morning Ukelele sing-along down on the beach.  We usually get coffee at the Kind Grind (right there on the beach) and just listen.  My 4 yr. old niece has even played along with the crowd.  (Don't expect skilled musicians but do expect friendliness and old time sing-along songs.) We have a Live Oak Farmer's Market on Sunday which is fantastic too!\r\n\r\nI love to entertain my friends and family from the East Coast at the beach house - they just cannot get over how idyllic life in Santa Cruz can be. I was born and raised outside of Boston, MA and relocated to the West Coast to work in the Software Industry. I hope you come enjoy Casa de Alta Loma and all it has to offer.\r\nThe location is ideal. You can hear the ocean, the sea lions, and the gulls but not the young neighboring renters who are right down on the beach.  It's a 2 minute walk to the harbor where you will find a favorite restaurant -- Johnny's Harborside.  It's a 4 minute walk to the beach which is wide and long. I often run the entire stretch from my beach down to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk all on the sand (at low tide!). It's about 13 minutes walk to the east entrance of the famous Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk.\r\nDriving gets you to a lot of popular destinations: E.g., Shadowbrook restaurant in Capitola is 3 miles away and SF and Big Sur are each about an hour and a half away, in opposite directions.",

Everything will be freshly vacuumed and cleaned, but if you have severe allergies our place might not be for you as cat & dog hair might be around even after the cleaning. We do have hardwood floors and just throw rugs that will be washed. Just want to be sure you know that we have pets in the house when we are here. Our cat is an outdoor cat (but when we are home he is both indoor/outdoor). He has a cat door into the garage for his food, water, bed.",

The Santa Cruz main beach is less than 10 minutes away by car, as is San Lorenzo Valley, home to Felton's Roaring Camp Railroad  and Hallcrest Vineyards (killer Pinot!), as well as Mount Hermon's Redwood Canopy Tours (zip-lining).  Further up the valley is the Big Basin  Redwoods State Park, with it's Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail, the Boulder Creek golf course and several organic farms which offer tours and farm-to-table dinners. Santa Cruz offers walking and biking on West Cliff Drive (where you can watch the surfers ride the waves) , beautiful beaches, the famous boardwalk, incredible restaurants, music venues, museums, and the Pacific Garden Mall.",
		"notes": "This is an excellent spot for mountain biking and hiking.  Henry Cowell State Park, which is right across the road, has 15 miles of hiking and riding trails through a variety of forested areas, including huge redwoods.  The garage is available upon request to store bicycles, surfboards, and other outdoor equipment.  Wine-tasting is also a popular past-time, since there are literally dozens of wineries nearby.",
		"transit": "There is a local bus on the closest major road, but most guests will arrive by car.  There is ample free parking in the driveway or in front of the house (which is very safe since our road is private).  Guests flying into San Jose should take Highway 17 towards Santa Cruz; those flying into San Francisco can take either Highway 17 or Highway 1 toward Santa Cruz.

My passion is gardening, and I also love hiking through the redwoods in the park across from my house.  I eat healthy (more or less), stay relatively physically fit, and try to maintain a good mental attitude.  I suppose I am a typical Santa Cruzer, pretty laid-back about most things.  Not the best cook in the world, although I occasionally get inspired to try something creative in the kitchen.  My style of guesting/hosting?

I live right next door to this rental with my adorable Jack Russell, Jerry Lee, so I will be available and nearby if you have any questions. \r\n\r\nI am a textile artist and own my own small business called Stand West, where I design and hand make a range of luxury, eco conscious accessories using custom dyed fabrics and mostly repurposed materials. If you are extra curious check out @standwestcreations on Instagram. \r\n\r\nIn addition to Stand West I am a Hip Hop Dance Teacher and work with Crush Sunglasses (a company based in the LA area) as their Northern California lifestyle rep. \r\n\r\nDespite growing up in beautiful Colorado and having the opportunity to explore every state in the USA, Santa Cruz has a strong hold on my heart. Here I spend the majority of my free time at the skate park located just a few blocks from Riverside Ranch, running on West Cliff, visiting the farmers markets that are held every day of the week throughout town, taking my dog to the beach, hiking in the redwoods with friends, and working with the community to make this city even better then it already is. \r\n\r\nI have been blessed beyond my own imagination to travel many places across the globe through the benefits of having  a mother as a Airline Stewardess. Because of all of my experiences being away from home I have a huge heart for making sure that your stay is the best it can be. Staying somewhere that feels like home, rather then in a hotel, makes all of the difference for me when I am exploring new places. Thank God for Airbnb. ; ) \r\n\r\nI hope to have the chance to get to know you and whether or not you decide to stay at Riverside Ranch I'll be wishing for you the best experiences while you are here in Santa Cruz. \r\n\r\nLight and Love!\r\n\r\nCharlie",

Obviously not everything in life is within our control and for those things we do have control over, then we have choices to make. Do we choose to enjoy what life has to offer? I try as much as my presence of mind is able. I am kind and generous; perhaps too much so at times according to my friends.

Just a 10 minute walk to restaurants, the Rio Theater, and shopping.  Whole Foods, Shoppers Corner and The Buttery (the best bakery in town) are a few blocks away.  Downtown and the wharf are a 25-30 min walk or a 7 minute drive.  UCSC, Capitola Village, and hiking in the Redwoods are all within a 10 minute drive as well.",
		"notes": "Two things to note about our property: 1)  We have a large, and VERY friendly dog.  We will try to keep her out of your way, but she will likely want to pay you a visit and is roaming the yard frequently.  If you stay here, we hope you like dogs! 2)  We have a chicken coop with 8, beautiful laying hens next to the guesthouse.  We think the chickens are lots of fun to watch, and are particularly fun if you have children.  Kids love to feed the chickens, and ours are very friendly.  Hens don't make nearly as much noise as roosters, but they do like to chatter and occasionally squawk.  We are not bothered by the noise and think it is a nice soft sound, but please be aware that you will hear the chickens. Also-- Santa Cruz charges an 11% occupancy tax.  For your convenience, we have included this charge in the nightly rate.",

		"notes": "Per Santa Cruz City law, we are required as Airbnb hosts to collect the Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) separately from your Airbnb transaction. The TOT is 11% of the nightly rate (before fees) for each night you stay. As this is a city tax, we are not allowed to collect this through Airbnb. We will collect this in cash or check upon check-in or during checkout. **********************  Check in is at 4PM  **********************  Check out is at 11AM  **********************  For guests that are planning on going to The Boardwalk:  Consider staying with us on a Monday or a Tuesday, as the Boardwalk has 1.00 rides, hot dogs, cotton candy & soda from 5PM to closing. It's a great bargain and tons of fun!  We offer an airport pickup and drop-off from SJO or SFO for an extra fee. Please let us know in advance if this is something you're interested in.

		"transit": "Walking and biking is the best way to appreciate the Santa Cruz scenery.  However, car rental services are available. There is a bus station on Pacific Ave. but there are many bus stops closer to your home away from home. The Metro Bus Station is where both local buses and Greyhound buses depart from. The Santa Cruz Trolley loops around Pacific Ave. and goes to the wharf and Boardwalk for only 25 cents! You can rent segway scooters down the street from the Boardwalk to use in that area. Information regarding rental services will be included in our information pamphlet, or emailed upon request. We do have a single parking driveway, and allot 1 guest pass for the permitted street parking.  A link to Santa Cruz parking map is available upon request. We're only a phone call away to answer any of your getting-around questions or to give directions. The Santa Cruz Information booth on Pacific Ave. is very informative and helpful as well.",

I have a passion for antiques and love a good DIY project!  \r\nI'm excited to be entering the Airbnb world! I love to travel and have found that chatting with the locals is the best way to explore a new town. I also adore Santa Cruz, so I am really looking forward to sharing my local insight with my Airbnb guests!",

Everything you'll need is within walking distance -- the beach, great restaurants, a brewery, a corner store and a couple fun locals bars!  Just a couple short blocks to Seabright Beach and a couple more to the Harbor! Watch the weekly boat races in the summer or go play in the waves, see amazing sea life or catch a stunning sunset just down the street at Seabright Beach! We are also very close to the the Crow's Nest, a popular Santa Cruz harbor beach destination.  You can walk to the Boardwalk in about five minutes as well! The free Friday night beach concerts in the summer are super fun! Not to mention the Boardwalk's rides, games and fun shops.  If you want a bit of a change of pace, you can also walk, ride your bike, drive or catch a cab to downtown. We are located in a banana belt -- we get more sun than our neighboring communities which is perfect for vacationing by the beach!",
		"notes": "- There are two housemates in the home who may be there during your stay and I will inform them of your arrival and departure. - The room is open and above the living room and the kitchen. Even though we are a relatively quite home most of the time, my housemates still listen to music, cook and do their thing at different times of day or night. It's usually fairly quiet but not for the super-sensitive quiet-needing person.  - We live behind a brewery so at times during the week it may be a bit loud for short spurts of time (on garbage/recycling days mid-week, for example). - I will send further instructions on what to do upon leaving, etc.  Thank you!",
		"transit": "Walking, riding bikes or skateboarding is the preferred mode of transportation in our neighborhood but the Santa Cruz Metro bus line is also conveniently located. It is easy to drive around and in and out of the neighborhood, too!",

I live right next door to this rental with my adorable Jack Russell, Jerry Lee, so I will be available and nearby if you have any questions. \r\n\r\nI am a textile artist and own my own small business called Stand West, where I design and hand make a range of luxury, eco conscious accessories using custom dyed fabrics and mostly repurposed materials. If you are extra curious check out @standwestcreations on Instagram. \r\n\r\nIn addition to Stand West I am a Hip Hop Dance Teacher and work with Crush Sunglasses (a company based in the LA area) as their Northern California lifestyle rep. \r\n\r\nDespite growing up in beautiful Colorado and having the opportunity to explore every state in the USA, Santa Cruz has a strong hold on my heart. Here I spend the majority of my free time at the skate park located just a few blocks from Riverside Ranch, running on West Cliff, visiting the farmers markets that are held every day of the week throughout town, taking my dog to the beach, hiking in the redwoods with friends, and working with the community to make this city even better then it already is. \r\n\r\nI have been blessed beyond my own imagination to travel many places across the globe through the benefits of having  a mother as a Airline Stewardess. Because of all of my experiences being away from home I have a huge heart for making sure that your stay is the best it can be. Staying somewhere that feels like home, rather then in a hotel, makes all of the difference for me when I am exploring new places. Thank God for Airbnb. ; ) \r\n\r\nI hope to have the chance to get to know you and whether or not you decide to stay at Riverside Ranch I'll be wishing for you the best experiences while you are here in Santa Cruz. \r\n\r\nLight and Love!\r\n\r\nCharlie",

		"host_about": "I purchased Casa de Alta Loma in 2013 as the fulfillment of a life-long dream to live close to a beautiful beach, in an environment that soothes the soul. I have lived in and around Santa Cruz for a decade now and finally decided on just the right spot (Live Oaks) and the perfect home (Alta Loma). I use it often and enjoy the environment tremendously.  For example, Stand Up Paddle in the harbor and out to sea is one of my favorite things to do - The SUP shack is minutes from my doorstep and if you're lucky, you'll see all sorts of marine life (whales too!). It's such a unique place - we even have a Saturday morning Ukelele sing-along down on the beach.  We usually get coffee at the Kind Grind (right there on the beach) and just listen.  My 4 yr. old niece has even played along with the crowd.  (Don't expect skilled musicians but do expect friendliness and old time sing-along songs.) We have a Live Oak Farmer's Market on Sunday which is fantastic too!\r\n\r\nI love to entertain my friends and family from the East Coast at the beach house - they just cannot get over how idyllic life in Santa Cruz can be. I was born and raised outside of Boston, MA and relocated to the West Coast to work in the Software Industry. I hope you come enjoy Casa de Alta Loma and all it has to offer.\r\nThe location is ideal. You can hear the ocean, the sea lions, and the gulls but not the young neighboring renters who are right down on the beach.  It's a 2 minute walk to the harbor where you will find a favorite restaurant -- Johnny's Harborside.  It's a 4 minute walk to the beach which is wide and long. I often run the entire stretch from my beach down to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk all on the sand (at low tide!). It's about 13 minutes walk to the east entrance of the famous Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk.\r\nDriving gets you to a lot of popular destinations: E.g., Shadowbrook restaurant in Capitola is 3 miles away and SF and Big Sur are each about an hour and a half away, in opposite directions.",

In Brazil I spend most of my time in dance classes, rehearsals, workshops, performing, out at dance performances, music events, surfing, or at home designing clothing in my studio. I met my husband Cristiano there, and he moved to California with me to experience life here.  We acquired this house, which is a definite fixer-upper, but we have made our way through a lot of projects one after another. We are still awaiting a great paint job, and some yard work, but the inside of our house by far surpasses it's outer appeal, lol. We are very accommodating to our guests, and are very centrally located close to everything! We also did Airbnb in Brazil when we were living there for about 2 years, and had a number of international guests stay with us. As you will see all of the reviews we got from our prior listings. We love Airbnb! It's a great way to rent out your space, and make friends while you are at it! :) I hope that you will enjoy our place here in the beautiful Santa Cruz!!! FYI I also teach private surf lessons and provide a surf board if you are interested...",

On the activities level I practice Brazilian Jiu Jitsu going five years now and... yes it's almost a religion for me.

You can take a connector bus from downtown Santa Cruz metro station.     Walking to Downtown:  Go downhill (East) on High Street.  Cross over Highway 1 bridge.   Continue on High Street.  Cross park diagonally.  Cross at crosswalk and walk down hill on Water Street.  The Clock Tower and Pacific Avenue are at the bottom of the hill.  Downtown will be to your right.  Other walking destinations:  it is about a 20 minute uphill walk through a residential neighborhood to get to the hiking trails of the Pogonip.  I recommend going down High Street to Highland.

West side Santa Cruz is the home of many restaurants and coffee houses and bakery's.  We have wine tasting and brewery's.  It's a great location for those who want to go to the university, the beach or downtown!  It's good for walkers because everything is close.  It's good for bikers with trails such as Wilder ranch a short ride away.  There's a bike shop close by to rent bikes if you'd like.  If you want to take public transportation, there's a bus stop at the end of the street.",

By day, I work in the veterinary field and my husband teaches environmental science to kids.  During our free time, together we enjoy traveling, snow boarding, rock climbing, scuba diving, music festivals and camping.  My biggest passion is horseback riding and my husband is a die hard surfer who also enjoys working in the garden and relaxing in his hammock while listening to reggae tunes.  We are both very passionate about the environment and doing our part to reduce our footprint on this planet. \r\n We love traveling and seeing the world and we make an effort to travel out of the county about every other year.  We have been to places such as Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Costa Rica, Panama, Nicaragua, Hawaii, Europe, Philippines and Sri Lanka.   When we travel, we travel without any specific agenda and let life guide us to where we belong.  All we need is our trusty Lonely Planet guide book and we find ourselves at great hostels where like minded travelers gather to share stories and experiences.  We enjoy good company and fun positive people that inspire us to become better individuals.  We are fortunate in where we live and the beautiful home we live in and we would be blessed to share it with others while we are out on our own life adventures.  Our motto in life: \"Find what you love and love what you find.\"",

Very close to our house at the end of our street there is beautiful Jose Avenue Park with a skate park, basketball courts, playground, and horseshoe pits.  We are within walking distance to Coffeetopia coffee shop, El Jardin Mexican Cuisine, Live Oak Market & Liquors.  If you do not want to drive while you're visiting, this is a great spot to be in.  Guests in the past have even hopped on the local bus line (which picks up at the end of our street) for the 2 minute ride to the Live Oak Beaches!",

Our local Santa Cruz Bus lines are cheap, convenient, and go to all the summer hot spots.  Cabs/Taxis are also cheap (about 5 from our house to downtown Pacific Ave.)  We also have a 2 car driveway, so if you have a rental car you will not have to park it on the street.  Bike riding is our method of transportation we prefer.  There is a bike rental shop right around the corner from our house!",

I will be traveling but available via text and phone. I also have a assistant in area George who can help you with anything you might need.

		"neighborhood_overview": "You will love the convenience of being able to walk downtown or ride our bikes to the beach! Downtown Santa Cruz is the best place to stay in my opinion. It is full of color and flavor and very beachy bohemian. There are lots of organic local made and inexpensive options for food as well as great cafes and lots of local made designers. Youll love shopping downtown as it is unique but inexpensive. Seabright is the closest beach and it is one of the best. The lighthouse is there and you will usually see otters swimming along the shore like mermaids. You can also go around the rocky cliff to the beach boardwalk. Sunsets are gorgeous. There is also a marsh downtown that is really nice to walk around if the beach is crowded. If you are here on the first friday of the month, this is called \"First Friday\" in Santa cruz and starting about 5pm the entire downtown will be filled with happy people walking around at art galleries and also take a quick hop over to the Tannery which also celebrates",

		"transit": "Street parking is usually available on the street right in front of the main house although now that it is the high season it may sometimes be necessary to look on an adjacent street to find parking. We are just two blocks from the downtown Santa Cruz transit center where you can find buses anywhere in the region. You can ride our 2 bikes downtown but be sure to lock them up well as bike theft is high in Santa Cruz. There is also a local trolley that can take you frm downtown to the beach.",

I love to see live music in small venues, and Santa Cruz is great for that.\r\nI travel a lot,  I go to Italy every year, since that's where I am from.  My entire family is there...but when I can, I go for long trips in other continents, other worlds, and find out how people live their lives in different corners of the world.\r\nI like to cook for friends, so my kitchen has every thing one might need, and I set up my home so that I can have friends visiting, spending time in the garden, spending the night...  hurray for friends!",

We're completely spoiled by easy access to the beach, the  Santa Cruz Mountains, downtown and the University.  We live in a great neighborhood, with a nice mix of neighbors and plenty of kids.  I like to think that we take advantage of much of what this area offers though in truth, often the kids and the neighbor's kids are content to just hang out in our backyard playing on the trampoline (not when you'll be visiting of course!).  Come check us out on the lower Westside of Santa Cruz, hopefully you'll love this place as much as we do.",

We both love our town and are excited to share it with you! \r\n\r\nWe are happily married and live with our wonderful 10 year old daughter. We LOVE to travel (our most recent trips include Portugal, Spain, and Peru)! We LOVE food (cooking, eating, trying new foods, you name it!) We love to be outdoors. We love to go backpacking, go for hikes, ride our bikes, and mushroom forage (no wonder we love Santa Cruz so much...). Most of all, we love to spend time with our friends and family. \r\n\r\nThis was our very first house that we bought almost 4 years ago. To say it was a fixer-upper is an understatement! We did as much of the work ourselves as we could manage. We are really proud of the way it turned out! We are thoroughly enjoying sharing our house and our home town with others on Airbnb! Our guests satisfaction is our number one priority and we are constantly striving to be better!",

The City of Santa Cruz levies an 11% Transient Occupancy Tax to be paid by all short-term guests.  Even though most cities have such a \u201chotel tax,\u201d Airbnb isn\u2019t yet set up to charge this (hopefully that changes soon!), and hosts are not allowed to include it in the rates.  Therefore we need to ask you to bring with you a check (payable to the City of Santa Cruz) or cash equivalent to 11% of what you paid airbnb.  Apologies for the awkwardness of this, and thank you for your understanding.",

You can take the slightly slower scenic route along the coast and check various surf spots and beach towns or take the fast lane on Highway 280 then Highway 17 when you reach San Jose. If you live in the Bay area and don\u2019t have a car, you can either take the Greyhound bus or you can take the Cal train to San Jose, then catch the highway 17 bus to downtown Santa Cruz. You can park for free in the surrounding blocks.

I love wining, dining and dancing! \r\nWhen I travel, I like to get into the vibe of a city as a local would do and always try to rent an apartment over a hotel as living in a neighborhood, having a kitchen, and catching a glimpse of what it would be like to live in the city I am visiting, adds to the experience of travel and make it more authentic and less touristy. I love to walk everywhere whenever possible so love to visit and explore cities that are walkable.. shopping and sightseeing by day and eating, drinking and dancing by night. I used to help students traveling abroad to Italy by finding them apartments, planning adventures for them and recommending all my favorite spots! I love to share my recommendations with people as having an amazing meal, or visiting a site that is not in a guidebook always make for a memorable trip. \r\n\r\nLife is short, live it to the fullest!",

Walk to the farmers market  on Wednesdays and make yourself a gourmet meal in the large fully equipped kitchen. Everything we mentioned is in walking distance, you wouldn't even need to rent a car!

		"notes": "********************** Check in is at 4PM ********************** Check out is at 11AM ********************** For guests that are planning on going to The Boardwalk:  Consider staying with us on a Monday or a Tuesday, as the Boardwalk has 1.00 rides, hot dogs, cotton candy & soda from 5PM to closing. It's a great bargain and tons of fun!  In accordance to Santa Cruz city laws, there will be a separate 11% transit occupancy tax to be paid in cash or check upon check in please. Based on availability, we offer an airport pickup and drop-off from SJO or SFO for an extra fee. Please let us know in advance if this is something you're interested in.  The house is equipped with basic spices, oils, salt/pepper, etc. in the kitchen. We have lots of extra towels, blankets and pillows.  YOU WILL NOT BE CHARGED FOR THE DEPOSIT. It is only an agreement that if you were to damage the house (spill wine on the carpet, break a window, etc) you agree to be financially responsible.  We strive to make stay",
		"transit": "Walking and biking is the best way to appreciate the Santa Cruz scenery.  However, car rental services are available. There is a bus station on Pacific Ave. but there are many bus stops closer to your home away from home. The Metro Bus Station is where both local buses and Greyhound buses depart from. The Santa Cruz Trolley loops around Pacific Ave. and goes to the wharf and Boardwalk for only 25 cents! You can rent segway scooters down the street from the Boardwalk to use in that area. Information regarding rental services will be included in our information pamphlet, or emailed upon request. We do have a single parking driveway, and allot 2 guest passes for the permitted street parking.  We're only a phone call away to answer any of your getting-around questions or to give directions. The Santa Cruz Information booth on Pacific Ave. is very informative and helpful as well.",

We worship the sun, but thrive under the moon and the stars when it's dark outside.

There will be some suggested activities including where to rent bikes and get surfing lessons when you arrive. The neighborhood is a very eclectic mix. Many single, 30 something professionals, young Latino families, college kids, hipsters, travelers, and artists. We love the hip, young, colorful vibe.",

While we await building permits we figured renting it over the summer would be a great way to help us with some of the building costs and bring some good juju to the house with fantastic people who will love visiting Santa Cruz. We welcome all the laughs, peace, and fun you likely will enjoy while visiting the property. May it bless you the way it is blessing us. BEWARE > Santa Cruz is known for petty theft... no matter where you stay... lock up the cars and gates to keep bikes safe.",
		"transit": "With so much to do within walking distance including grocery shopping and the beach... you really don't need a car. However there's plenty of street parking and most of downtown is metered parking. Our neighborhood is perfect for biking, bring your own or rent one from one of the bike shops nearby. The bus system around Santa Cruz is relatively good. There's a bus stop on our street. Taxi's are readily available and Uber is here too! We recommend the Santa Cruz Flyer if you need an airport ride.  The closest airport to Santa Cruz is San Jose (35 minutes) - airport code: SJC. Other airports would be Oakland (OAK), San Francisco (SFO), Monterey (MRY)",

We also love to stay close to home and work in the yard and garden where we can visit with our chickens and rabbit.  We feel blessed to live in this beautiful area.  Here on the \"Westside\" we can walk to great eateries, brew pubs, wineries, and go shopping just up the road at the local health food store. We are a busy family with the kids engaged in sports and music, but love to spend time visiting with our guests - sharing a glass of wine or a pint of ale helping you get the lay of the land and work on interesting itineraries. If time and schedules permit maybe we could even get out on the bay in kayaks or stand up paddle boards where you can get up close and personal with otters, seals and whales, or get into the into Santa Cruz's amazing mountains on mountain bikes, then hit up the organic microbrew pub on the way home....  So much to do - all without ever needing to get into your car!",

You can take a connector bus from downtown Santa Cruz metro station.  Walking to Downtown: Go downhill (East) on High Street. Cross over Highway 1 bridge. Continue on High Street. Cross park diagonally. Cross at crosswalk and walk down hill on Water Street. The Clock Tower and Pacific Avenue are at the bottom of the hill. Downtown will be to your right.  Other walking destinations: it is about a 20 minute uphill walk through a residential neighborhood to get to the hiking trails of the Pogonip. I recommend going down High Street to Highland.

I love going to the beach when it is sunny and warm, and am lucky to live in one of the most beautiful and unique beach towns in the United States.  I am not a vegetarian, and cook most of my meals at home, only going out for food occassionally.  I'm home most evenings, and usually stay awake until around 11pm.  I drink alcohol, and am 420 friendly.  I used to smoke cigarettes, but recently quit, my guests are asked to smoke outside on the back deck.",

You can take a connector bus from downtown Santa Cruz metro station.  Walking to Downtown: Go downhill (East) on High Street. Cross over Highway 1 bridge. Continue on High Street. Cross park diagonally. Cross at crosswalk and walk down hill on Water Street. The Clock Tower and Pacific Avenue are at the bottom of the hill. Downtown will be to your right.  Other walking destinations: it is about a 20 minute uphill walk through a residential neighborhood to get to the hiking trails of the Pogonip. I recommend going down High Street to Highland. Make a left and walk up Highland to Spring Street. Pogonip trails are at the end of Spring Street.  Bus #10 High Street bus will take you to UCSC. (nearest",

We ask guests to be very careful when snacking in the cottage, as crumbs and food scraps attract ants. It is best to snack outside, please feel free to use the patio tables and chairs for meals. Please do not rinse food scraps in the sink or bathtub, as they clog the plumbing. Please do not eat in bed, as food stains the linens. We don't use pesticides, and rely on cleanliness to keep the ants out in the yard where they belong. Please toss used food and drink containers in the trash cans in the driveway, and not in the wastebaskets in the cottage.  Thank you for helping us keep the cottage super-clean and insect-free.",

		"neighborhood_overview": "Our neighborhood is a relatively quiet neighborhood with an assortment of people who enjoy living near the beach--including long-time residents, families, retired people, UCSC students, and surfers interspersed to keep it characteristic of Santa Cruz.  Two blocks away is a modest shopping center which hosts the local farmer's market on Sunday mornings. A handful of eateries and a coffee shop, from fast food to upscale dining, line the two blocks toward the beaches. A back way to the beach (our special secret) is three lovely blocks, two of which are walking/biking trails, one lined with Cypress trees, and the next along a lagoon lined with Eucalyptus trees. The Harbor and Crows Nest restaurant and nightclub are a several blocks to the west along the shore. Downtown Santa Cruz is 3 miles west and Capitola, a quaint seaside town, is 2 miles east. Both are easily accessible by bike lanes, public transportation and car.",

We ask that you pay us in the blue envelope you will see on the desk when you arrive, either with a personal check or cash.  Our house has three AirBnB rooms, and sound travels in our home, so please be considerate of others during our quiet hours (9:00pm to 7:30am). Because we are a shoes-free home, slip-on slippers and slip-on garden shoes are handy to leave inside and outside the door. Check-in time is 3:00pm and check-out time is 11:00am. Feel free to leave luggage on the porch and make yourselves at home if you wish to arrive early or stay late. Santa Cruz area has been suffering a severe water shortage, and water is rationed. We have installed low flush toilets, we re-use grey water when possible, and we ask our guests to minimize their water usage.  NOTE: If you are interested in receiving massage, acupuncture, cranio-sacral therapy or Rolfing here, then message me and I will send yo",

The local bus service hooks up with service to San Jose, Caltrain, and all the Bay Area Transit systems including both San Jose and San Francisco Airports. From the airport, use Bay Area Transit system to Diridon Station in San Jose. From there you can catch the Hwy 17 Express to Santa Cruz. From the Santa Cruz downtown station take Santa Cruz Metro Bus 66 or 68 (Live Oak) to the bus stop nearest the intersection of 17th and Portola. The intersection is 2 blocks from our house. Car travel is convenient . . . street parking with no meters along our street. We use our carport as an unloading/loading zone for our guests' convenience.

We keep gentle gardens and cosy comfortable atmosphere for people who want a time of  renewal for body and soul. Mornings we visit the quiet beach to listen to the surf and watch the dawn, and evenings the dusk. We invite guests to join us for early morning yoga and/or meditation in our common room or on the lawn by the pond and waterfall. We have a list of massage therapists and acupuncturists who have offered to deliver their services to our guests in their private rooms. A lovely couple, Melissa and Rodney, are caretaking for us through Sept. 30 while we travel. We know you will enjoy their hosting in our home!",

From the Airport we are a short 30 minute over the mountain depending on what time of day and year you come could be as long as an hour.  There is a bus that comes over the hill and bus service around town.  Best to come with a car and park it for the weekend and get around by foot and bike.  We have a driveway for our guests.",

Terry grew up in CT  and has lived in Boulder, Manhattan  & SF. We are school teachers at a private school here.  As well, Terry has spent much of her working life as a food enthusiast and caterer (with the help of Clint) and she enjoys cooking fresh, healthy food from our farmer's markets.  We are passionate about the environment and do what we can to be living a green and sustainable life all around.  We love Santa Cruz and love to share it with people traveling through.   We welcome guests from around the globe  and we look forward to meeting new friends from different places.   We love traveling and getting lost in new cities and discovering their food specialties.  We also enjoy being in nature & by water, walking, music and life!  \r\n\r\nThis section is for Guests reading about us prior to submitting a Reservation Request:\r\n\u2022 Airbnb is a trusted community marketplace with a mission to connect each Guest with an ideally matched Host. As a Guest, you can better your chances of an approval by posting a profile photo and a bit about yourself (and also who you are traveling with if that applies).\r\n\u2022 As a guest, you of course would want to know as much about your host as possible to assure your safety and peace of mind. Additionally your host also wants to know about the people that will be sharing his/her home.\r\n\u2022 We have never met and we know nothing about you so take a few moments to tell me who you are, what you like, what are your passions, hobbies etc.. No need to write a book just a few lines to give us a sense of who you are.\r\n\u2022 To improve the chance of your request being accepted a complete profile is essential. A COMPLETE PROFILE includes a written statement about who you are, a recent photo of your face (no pets or children), and a verified email address and phone number. Doing these small things will increase the odds of an approved booking by tenfold. This is true for inquiries you make of any Host, not only us.\r\n\u2022 VERIFY YOUR ID. You are going to be required to do this eventually, so do it now while you aren't pressed for time. It only takes a few minutes and it shows you value trust in our community. (See https://www.airbnb.com/help/question/450 for more information about Verified ID.)",

Parking is on the street and does not require a permit.  It is a short bike ride or a nice walk to downtown on the river path. The cottage is a short walk to Seabright Brewery (live music on Friday nights!), La Posta (one of our favorite restaurants), Seabright Beach, the Boardwalk and the San Lorenzo River path.",
		"notes": "There is a modem and wireless router for internet access at the cottage.   We don't have cable TV because we like to catch up on watching movies on DVD while we are there. There are Redbox kiosks at the nearby Safeway and 7-Eleven.  You can get some local channels using the converter box and antenna.   Because of the extreme Santa Cruz water shortage, please take short showers and use the on-off valve on the shower head to turn off the water when soaping up.  There is a washer and dryer but please only wash full loads on the shortest cycle.  We will take back to Fremont the sheets and towels to wash them.  If you have enough dirty dishes go ahead and run the dishwasher on its shortest cycle.  Keep the strainer in the kitchen drain and don't put anything down the sinks except for water.  Put food scraps in the compost not down the sink.",
		"transit": "There is a bus stop a couple short blocks away.  We primarily walk or ride our bikes when we are there.  The closest big airport is San Jose International which is about a half-hour drive (except during commute hours).",

A park with a little lake and a great playground. Kids can get their first fishing experience at the lake.

We are less than ten minutes from all of the excitement at the Boardwalk (we like to ride our bikes, just coming back up the hill is a work out \u2014 takes about 15 minutes- this way we don\u2019t have to pay for parking!). Downtown is brisk walk or a short 5 min. drive.  If you walk along West Cliff to the lighthouse you can watch the pro-surfers do their tricks at Steamers Lane. If you walk the other way on West Cliff you can visit the Monarch butterfly sanctuary at Natural Bridges State Park. We are a short ways away from the natural grocery store (New Leaf), Safeway, and many restaurants/ameni",

We love our beach lifestyle and enjoy sharing it with others, including our two French Bulldogs, Lola and Napoleon.When not working, we enjoy the beach, sports, painting, exercising, and hanging out with friends and family. Its fun to stroll along East Cliff Dr, watching the surfers and marine life as we head to our destination. Capitola is loaded with fine restaurants,unique shops, and wine tasting . We take advantage of it all. We walk past the Hook to witness some of the best surfing on the West Coast. If we're in the mood for a movie or need to go to the Mall its a short walk in the other direction. Take in the sunset at the end of our street where you can also see Steamers Lane, the Boardwalk, and Monterey across the bay.We welcome you to join us and experience the beauty of this special place.",

With the ocean just four blocks away, and more than one local state park, we welcome lots of nature lovers. We have quite a few families visit - sometimes even three generations of fun-loving folks. We also have couples come for romantic getaways, and groups of friends visit for surfing, biking, and jogging along West Cliff. Some people come just to go to the beach, and others for work. Some people come to get away from the heat of the valley, and others for the sweet, temperate sunshine.",
		"notes": "Santa Cruz has a 10pm city-wide quiet ordinance. Artisan Beach House is in a peaceful family neighborhood that respects this ordinance, and we welcome you to join us if you feel this is a match to your vacation style. If you prefer the louder, later style of vacation, we ask you that you respect our neighbors, and find a rental better suited for your vacation.",

The beach town of Davenport is fifteen minutes away, and boasts a good restaurant (the Roadhouse), a locally-famous cafe/bakery (the Whale City), frequent live music, and a sprinkling of shops, all with Pacific views. The mountain towns of Felton, Ben Lomond, and Boulder Creek area also nearby and quaint. Nearby Santa Cruz is full of charms that include and transcend its tourist-spot reputation! Don't miss going to the beach - the boardwalk for tourist tradition, or colorful Capitola, or one of many secluded coves. Enjoy the chic Pacific Avenue M",

Two blocks away is a modest shopping center which hosts the local farmer's market on Sunday mornings. A handful of eateries and a coffee shop, from fast food to upscale dining, line the two blocks toward the beaches. A back way to the beach (our special secret) is three lovely blocks, two of which are walking/biking trails, one lined with Cypress trees, and the next along a lagoon lined with Eucalyptus trees. The Harbor and Crows Nest restaurant and nightclub are a several blocks to the west along the shore. Downtown Santa Cruz is 3 miles west and Capitola, a quaint seaside town, is 2 miles east. Both are easily accessible by bike lanes, public transportation and car.",

We keep gentle gardens and cosy comfortable atmosphere for people who want a time of  renewal for body and soul. Mornings we visit the quiet beach to listen to the surf and watch the dawn, and evenings the dusk. We invite guests to join us for early morning yoga and/or meditation in our common room or on the lawn by the pond and waterfall. We have a list of massage therapists and acupuncturists who have offered to deliver their services to our guests in their private rooms.

The empty lot immediately adjacent to the creek and the driveway was once the epicenter and final party place of the famed pleasure point bike race - however, since the last residents moved out the home has since been torn down and the party is held in another part of the neighborhood. Its now an awesome, make-shift dog park and if you have a doggie, Im sure they will find it full of smells of the neighborhood dogs. The beach is literally 3 blocks down the road and the sunset walks a must for everyone on the block - we all grab a glass of wine and head down to the cliffs with doggies in tow. We have a very loving, communal group of neighbors and we all watch out for one another.",
		"notes": "I have a large German Pointer named Richard Rex, he is a 10 year old, lovable family dog that might bark - but he is confined to the front yard at all times. Unless you want to make friends. I have two - three old beach cruisers that are available for you use, however, they are old and rickety - renting beach cruisers is always convenient and I can provide any gear outfitters you may fancy - just let me know what your interests are before you arrive and I can compile a short list.",

When I first heard about airbnb I thought it was a wonderful way to create a source of connection for my sons and I with a community that we would otherwise not have the opportunity to be a part of.  We have met some fabulous people and our home life  is so much more interesting since becoming airbnb hosts.\n\nI am an artist and love to garden so the home is an eclectic mix of colorful textiles and found objects. At times I am working on a commissioned painting, or leading art workshops, but if not then I am out mountain biking or playing with my kids.\r\n  We have two older doggies and a big garden, are centrally located for lots of explorations of Santa Cruz. When you stay with us you are welcome to be part of the family or remain tucked away in your little cabin room in the back of the garden.",

		"description": "A delightful bed, a delightful view, a delightful shower. Weather you are traveling or here for business, you will wake up refreshed.  My place is near everything and I say everything, from downtown to the beach, retaurants, entertainment,essentials The bedroom is private and a little heaven. It has its own entrance and is detached from the main house. The bed is super comfy and the room gets very cozy from the sunshine or with a little space heater. The space is an old art studio where  my sister created a lot of the art that is around the house,  from drift woods picked up from the local beach or Poem painted on fabric from Baudelaire. This a place you will remember.  I offer Tea in the morning and a full Breakfast is available upon request for an extra fee. Please inquire. We will share my bathroom in the main house by walking outside on a wooden deck  (about 55 feet away, which is lite at night with solar lights. One bike is available to tour Santa Cruz. Please bring your own lock.",

		"neighborhood_overview": "My neighborhood is full of great staff. If you are in town to work, grab a coffee and breakfast around the corner, if you are here to entertain, then do the same. You will be as far from the beach as you are from  downtown. if you decide to go relax in a hot tub or get a massage there is a Retreat/Spa down the street for me. Great restaurants, music places, spas, coffee shops, groceries, Usps store......seriously I bike everywhere.  There are also tones of touristic activities to do in Santa Cruz, from water sport (if you want to start paddling, I can direct you where to go), to the mystery house, up the road from me (a house where gravity defies rules), to garden tours, wineries, hiking in the national forest (redwoods), galleries, First Friday of the month (open museums and galleries), wonderful farmers markets (after all CA is the orchard of United States).",
		"notes": "Please make sure you read the entire description, so there is no surprise regarding your (email hidden)e shared bathroom is separate from your bedroom and across the backyard about 55 feet. It makes it very private, but for those of you who need access to the bathroom frequently it can be an inconvenience. The price will offset that :).",

I have been the host of many travelers from all over the world since then, because I believe in sharing experiences, differences and I want to open up my place to the world. I have a green home, where I am mindful of electrical usage and water usage (be aware of the drought)! I am a foodie,   I grow my vegetables. I am always looking for more ideas and new tips to do things yourself. When you come to visit I will give you a tour of my place. I like to share my knowledge and find out about yours.",

(If you live in the Bay area and don\u2019t have a car, you can either take the Greyhound bus or the Cal train to San Jose, then catch the highway 17 bus to downtown Santa Cruz). THE SCENIC ROUTE TO & FROM SF: Take the slightly slower scenic route along the \"Slow Coast\" from Pacifica past Half Moon Bay, through Pescadero and Davenport. Be sure to check out the surf along the way and grab a few tacos at the Gas Station in Pescadero (Mercado & Taqueria De Amigos).",

Redwood Drive is just that, a 2.5 mile long drive, one lane-ish mountain road with a cul-de-sac. So no annoying traffic noise or city hustle bustle worries and not to close to any of my great neighbors. It's very safe, \"over the top\" peaceful easy living where you can go walking or biking or just hang out.",
		"notes": "The Redwood House is exceptional in that although it is in the Santa Cruz Mountains, unlike other valley, canyon or remote locations that don't open up to daylight or a have a view because of the forests, this location is naturally open, airy, light and spacious with great views of the hills and on a clear evening, our beautiful Monterrey Bay starry night sky.",
		"transit": "You'll need a vehicle of course and there is plenty of room to park on the gated property. Lots of people bike in Santa Cruz and in this area, so that's cool and it's easy to travel locally or get out of town as well.

		"host_about": "My love of food, cooking, wine and art has lead me on a lifelong journey. Years ago, I was a restauranteur in Chicago, then a full time studio potter, then a career in corporate sales and marketing.\r\n\r\nI've traveled extensively, usually on a quest to find indigenous, traditional regional foods. Desert beans in India, grilled squid from a street vendor in Hong Kong, fresh rambutan in Thailand, black mole in Mexico, and hay soup in Austria are just a few memorable tastes. I am inspired by these experiences and I cook with international flavors.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, I began to dream about having a farm where I could produce more of the foods, meats, and wines that I love. That dream came true when we bought FlipJack Ranch. Ranch life suits me, waking up to gather fresh eggs, cuddling the baby chicks, wrangling the goats, walking out to see the wooly pigs with a cup of coffee in hand. The whole 'farm to table' thing is real here on the ranch and the sustainable, organic and free range food products are my inspiration for daily menus. I love to forage too, here or nearby,  bringing back mushrooms, salad greens or mussels for the table. \r\n\r\nAs a traveler myself, I value warm hospitality and those little things that make a stay memorable. I love it when I can go to a place and just unwind, assured that everything is there and I can just relax. I hope to make your stay with us memorable.",

The TOT is 11% of the nightly rate (before fees) for each night you stay. As this is a city tax, we are not allowed to collect this through Airbnb. We will collect this in cash or check upon check-in or during checkout.

There is a bus station on Pacific Ave. but there are many bus stops closer to your home away from home. The Metro Bus Station is where both local buses and Greyhound buses depart from. The Santa Cruz Trolley loops around Pacific Ave. and goes to the wharf and Boardwalk for only 25 cents! You can rent segway scooters down the street from the Boardwalk to use in that area. Information regarding rental services will be included in our information pamphlet, or emailed upon request. 1 guest pass is available for the permitted street parking. A link to the Santa Cruz parking map is available upon request. We're only a phone call away to answer any of your getting-around questions or to give directions. The Santa Cruz Information booth on Pacific Ave. is very informative and helpful as well.",

		"neighborhood_overview": "This is a well cared for space in a great neighborhood, half a mile from UCSC and walking distance to downtown. I am happy to say the neighbors are all really friendly and we often stop to visit with each other. There is a coffee shop just around the corner called The Abbey, which is a great meeting place. Also close to Hwy 1 (Mission St) and Hwy 17 and 1.5 miles from Cowell Beach where you can surf, rent kayaks, or just walk along beautiful West Cliff Drive ..and 3.6 miles from Upper Wilder Ranch and amazing mountain bike trails. The down hill traffic from UCSC can back up in front of the house as they wait to get onto Hwy 1. This usually occurs in the afternoon and doesn't last that long. The traffic in Santa Cruz in general has gotten a lot heavier in the afternoons everywhere. Since my house is very central, I do a lot of walking and biking. The walk to downtown is literally six blocks and highly recommended. Ask me for walking directions!",
		"notes": "The master bedroom and bath are large. The room is approximately 15' x 15' with a large desk and a smaller pull out sofa.  The second bedroom is much smaller than the master, still very very nice. The room is 8'x9' and has a large operable skylight as opposed to a window.  It has it's own bathroom with shower that is attached to it. There is a door separating the bedroom and bathroom.",

		"neighborhood_overview": "Many people who have visited say they are surprised by what they see when they walk through our gate- it's not what they expected from the outside (a mixture of single story older homes- like ours, newer 2 story homes, attractive condos, and a mobile home park across the street). The stone entry path is edged by bamboo, a fountain, and plants that evoke a lush, tropical feeling. Though we have easy access to the freeway, it feels like you're far from the busy-ness of city life.  Our neighborhood is diverse in income levels and cultural backgrounds and is at the edge of a riparian corridor, so it has a little bit of wilderness even though it's in the middle of town. On our street are a nursery, a friendly auto mechanic, and a house with horses. It feels somewhat rural, even though we have such easy access to many parts of town. We are close enough to ride a bike to the ocean in about 15 minutes, but are also close to nice hiking trails in the mountains with redwoods and streams. Within",
		"notes": "We will provide  tea or coffee with fruit, granola, and yogurt in the morning.  We have a small dog and a cat who live in the house. My daughter's dog, Pickle, stays with us sometimes. He barks when new people come, but quiets down quickly if you don't reach down to pet him or give him too much attention. He can be very sweet and loves to play once he's assured you're okay.",
		"transit": "A major bus line is located about 5 blocks from our house. You can walk to 41st Ave. in less than 15 minutes where there are coffee shops, a mall, and restaurants. The best way to get here from the airport is to rent a car, take the bus (easier from San Jose, more challenging from SFO), or hire an airport shuttle service (available for 40-100). This is a wonderful location for bike riding! Bike rentals are available nearby, and we have two bikes available for loan- a cruiser and a 3 speed. They're not the most beautiful, but they work!",

		"host_about": "Five things I can't live without.... farmer's markets, 4-legged furry creatures that like to snuggle and sit on my lap, birds singing in my garden, my bicycle, time with my kids. I would also say living by the ocean, but I suppose I could live near a river, lake, or stream in the mountains as long as I make regular treks to the ocean!\r\n\r\nI am a high school teacher and live with my partner, Dan, who is a builder in Santa Cruz County. My daughter (in her 20s) is also temporarily living with us. I have lived in Santa Cruz since 1980 and Dan grew up in the area. We love spending time in nature: hiking, biking, kayaking, and paddleboarding. Interests include salsa rueda dancing, local history, marine life, traditional plant uses, permaculture, cooking, gardening, and observing the many species of birds in our backyard. Dan has surfed here for decades, so can advise good surf spots. He also knows of a fun archery range in the redwoods nearby. We love showing people around our area! We strive to be conscientious of our environment and are excited that our home is now powered by solar panels!!\r\n\r\nI have traveled to many places, including Mexico, Jamaica, Ecuador, Bali, Java, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Costa Rica, Belize, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Philippines, Norway, Greece, Turkey, and Tanzania. I recently climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro with my daughter- the hardest thing I've ever done. Of course, a safari in the Serengeti was a childhood dream that was also fulfilled on that trip. Camping and cross country skiing are favorite things to do in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, where I go several times a year. I have driven across the United States 4 times (when gas was cheaper and before my understanding of global climate change issues) and was able to visit many of our National Parks, like Yosemite, Yellowstone, Death Valley, and the Grand Canyon. When I visit another culture, I love to immerse myself by learning some of the language, eating local food, and exploring the history and social background. I prefer staying at hostels or homestays over big hotels. A little adventure, time in nature, and physical activity are always important to me. \r\n\r\nI grew up in Illinois- until I was 14, when I moved to California to live with my mother. My mother is the 10th woman to solo circumnavigate the world and now lives in Mexico, so I've spent quite a bit of time sailing and living on boats. Now I prefer a kayak or paddleboarding, as they give more opportunities for observing wildlife. I once worked as a crewmember on a whalewatching boat. I've also been a veterinary aide, exotic animal caretaker, stained glass artist, and a docent in the state parks. \r\n\r\nMy favorite part about hosting air bnb guests is discovering how much we have in common. I am inspired to know there are so many people out there from all parts of the world who are thoughtful, fun, interesting, and with a good sense of humor- and who share my passion about caring for this amazing planet we call home. It's so fun to share ideas- I've gotten many helpful tips from guests on how to live more sustainably. The biggest surprise was a guest who had an aunt that was my neighbor and shared a driveway with me for 5 years!",

		"host_about": "My love of food, cooking, wine and art has lead me on a lifelong journey. Years ago, I was a restauranteur in Chicago, then a full time studio potter, then a career in corporate sales and marketing.\r\n\r\nI've traveled extensively, usually on a quest to find indigenous, traditional regional foods. Desert beans in India, grilled squid from a street vendor in Hong Kong, fresh rambutan in Thailand, black mole in Mexico, and hay soup in Austria are just a few memorable tastes. I am inspired by these experiences and I cook with international flavors.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, I began to dream about having a farm where I could produce more of the foods, meats, and wines that I love. That dream came true when we bought FlipJack Ranch. Ranch life suits me, waking up to gather fresh eggs, cuddling the baby chicks, wrangling the goats, walking out to see the wooly pigs with a cup of coffee in hand. The whole 'farm to table' thing is real here on the ranch and the sustainable, organic and free range food products are my inspiration for daily menus. I love to forage too, here or nearby,  bringing back mushrooms, salad greens or mussels for the table. \r\n\r\nAs a traveler myself, I value warm hospitality and those little things that make a stay memorable. I love it when I can go to a place and just unwind, assured that everything is there and I can just relax. I hope to make your stay with us memorable.",

		"neighborhood_overview": "'Westside Wonderful' is located in 'The Circles' in Westside Santa Cruz. It has an interesting history: \"The Circles is largely considered a \u201cmarvelous planning disaster\u201d by the architecturally minded. It was developed in a haphazard fashion. Tent homes made of plywood and canvas were common in the early years. The circle pattern also resulted in many odd and substandard-sized lots; many are between 2,000 and 3,000 square feet, while a standard city lot is (phone number hidden). Today you will see many large houses with strange angles crammed into these tiny lots. That said, the neighborhood does have a more cohesive feel than many. It still has a local market and a distinctive laid back and friendly atmosphere; a good thing since it\u2019s so easy to get turned around!\"",
		"notes": "We have two small dogs: Reina (a white Lhasa/Terrier mix---sweetest dog ever,) and Hopper (a long-haired dachshund who is more like Eeyore!) If they happen to be outside, they will bark to greet you, but do not be alarmed---just come on through the gate and you will become their new best friend within 5 seconds. The city of Santa Cruz levies an 11% Transient Occupancy Tax that is included in the price, which we then give to the city. Santa Cruz City TOT Registration Certificate #738-955.",
		"transit": "There is a greenbelt that provides a pleasant six block walk to the ocean, at West Cliff Drive, and as noted there are several cafes, bakeries, wineries, breweries and restaurants within walking distance (10 minutes) or a very short drive. It's 1.5 miles to downtown Santa Cruz's Pacific Avenue, so again a short drive, or a 30-minute walk. The Bus Stop to take the Number 20 bus to the Beach Boardwalk and downtown, or to Natural Bridges State Park and the UC Santa Cruz campus is just two blocks away.",
